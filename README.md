# vue-test-firebase

The scope of this project is to try and integrate the google product that I use in order to build a potential CRM...

I hope this will work;

## Phase 1

- Setup Firebase and dotenv (so github don't get mine apiKey).
- Try and send a test message using console.log
- Try and receive a message from the sent message

## Phase 2

- Setup Google Calendar API
